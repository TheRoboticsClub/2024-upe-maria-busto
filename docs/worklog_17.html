                        <p class="lead" align="justify">Here are the tasks I have been working on during this 17th week of internship at JdeRobot: </p> 

                            <ul class="errors-list" align="justify">
                                <li align="justify"><a>First, I have reviewed the update of an existing Robotics Academy deployment with Node 17 and added the explanatory note about this in the documentation.</a>
                                </li>

                                <br>

                                <li><a>Also, I have completed the migration from node-sass to sass in RA and tested the exercises in both developer and user mode with scripts and docker-compose to confirm that everything works properly in RA with sass. In principle, everything works well. Therefore, I have opened a Pull Request and Carlos has reviewed it. With this, the issue has been closed.</a></li> 

                                <br>

                                <li><a>On the other hand, I have again continued with Unibotics’ automatic evaluation issue. I have noticed that the style evaluation is already patched from old commits.</a>

                                <br> 
                                <br>

                                <a>As for the efficacy evaluation, I have managed to fixed it in the Vacuum Cleaner exercise by moving the specific code of Unibotics from the submodule to the folder uniboticsExtra of Unibotics. With this, I have to finish doing more testing and duplicate the solution to the Localized Vacuum Cleaner case to end up with the efficacy evaluation problem in the case of vacuum cleaners exercises.</a> 

                                <br> 
                                <br>

                                <a>Regarding the efficacy evaluation in Follow Line, I have not been able to progress with it.</a>

                                </li>

                                <br>

                                <li><a>Finally, I have reviewed the use of ports in the efficacy evaluation to see if port 7164 was being used for this and found that, in the case of the style evaluation, this port is being used to mount the corresponding request.</a></li>
                            </ul>
