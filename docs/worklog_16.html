                        <p class="lead" align="justify">Here are the tasks I have been working on during this 16th week of internship at JdeRobot: </p> 

                            <ul class="errors-list" align="justify">
                                <li align="justify"><a>I have continued working on the Node 16 to Node 17 version upgrade at Robotics Academy. In the last tests I did, an error related to CORS requests was showing. However, I have re-tested it and when deploying RA with the necessary updates to use Node 17, this error no longer shows up.</a>

                                <br>
                                <br> 

                                <a>On the other hand, I’ve been researching how to update Robotics Academy’s dependencies needed to accept and use Node 17 in RA (lint-staged and execa) without directly modifying the “yarn.lock” file, since this is not the right way. Finally, I have managed to update the dependencies by modifying the version of lint-staged in the “package.json” file. With this, and by doing yarn install, the rest of the dependencies are automatically updated and Robotics Academy can use Node 17.</a>

                                <br>
                                <br> 

                                <a>I have also updated the Node installation commands in the RA "develop_academy" script so that Node 17 is now installed instead of Node 16.</a>

                                <br>
                                <br> 

                                <a>I have reviewed Robotics Academy functioning with Node 17 in user mode and developer mode, both with docker compose and with scripts, and everything seems to work well.</a>

                                <br>
                                <br> 

                                <a>Finally, I have updated Robotics Academy’s developer documentation to include the new Node 17 installation commands and I have opened a Pull Request. However, Carlos has reviewed this pull request and had a number of issues in the process of updating an existing deployment with Node 17. This error comes from the need to perform a yarn install to update the dependencies on the existing RA deployment. Therefore, an explanatory note needs to be included in the documentation.</a>


                                </li>

                                <br>

                                <li><a>On the other hand, I have started to investigate the migration process from node-sass to sass at Robotics Academy. I have performed a test of this migration process and it has successfully migrated to sass with the respective dependencies been updated correctly too. Also, I have tested two Robotics Academy exercises in developer mode to check the migration and everything seems to work well.</a></li> 

                                <br>

                                <li><a>Also, I have been reviewing with Carlos the Robotics Academy’s broken pipe problem. We think the problem comes from a RAM step that closes a socket rather than the ports, but we continue to investigate.</a></li>

                                <br>

                                <li><a>I have found an error in Unibotics on D3 where the version of the Robotics Backend being used is shown as "undefined" on the interface. I have reported this and opened an issue.</a></li>

                                <br>

                                <li><a>Finally, I have renewed my expired D2 account. Regarding the efficacy evaluation issue, I was unable to progress with it.</a></li>
