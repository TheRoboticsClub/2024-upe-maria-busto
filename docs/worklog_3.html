                        <p class="lead" align="justify">During this third week of internship, I have finished researching and watching video tutorials about Django. I have also finished reading the first steps section of Django’s official webpage, learning about Django’s main features and functioning.</p>

                        <p class="lead" align="justify">On the other hand, I’ve finished creating my first webpage with React. Specifically, I have organized the code, making certain components more reusable by using object arrays, list mapping and props. An example of this would be the NavBar component (navigation bar). Also, I have added a state to the SideBar component (log list) and its search bar, which allows filtering between the available logs based on the value marked by the user in the search, and an OnClick event to the bottom button of the webpage, thus allowing to return to the beginning of it. The result of the webpage can be found in the following video:</p>

                        <br></br>
                        <div align="center">
                            <video class="first-React-webpage" width="750px" height="380px" controls>
                                <source src="assets/First-React-Webpage.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                                <p>Video about my first React webpage. This video can't be played in your browser.</p>
                            </video>
                        </div>
                        <br></br>

                        <p class="lead" align="justify">Once these two tasks had been completed, I have read some of the documentation found in the unibotics-webserver repository, such as the documentation that explains the repository’s directory structure. I have also started and practically finished the D1 deployment of Unibotics. After many attemps and issues, I have practically finished it, being able to see the Unibotics webpage locally, as well as Django’s admin webpage.  Despite this, I still have to download and launch the RADI as well as review some issues found both in the local Unibotics webpage and the Django admin.</p>

                        <p class="lead" align="justify">During this deployment, I have found some typos and errors in the D1 deployment documentation which I have taken note of so that, this week, I can: check them; open a GitHub Issue; and patch them.</p>

                        <p class="lead" align="justify">Finally, I have started to review the source code of unibotics-webserver, to get a general idea of how it works.</p>
